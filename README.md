## Skills Displayed: 
* Calculating and applying regression analysis to datasets
* Understanding the difference between linear and non-linear data 
* Understanding  how to quantify and validate linear models
* Understanding how to apply scaling and normalization as part of the data preprocessing step in machine learning
* Understanding how to calculate and apply the fundamental classification algorithms: logistic regression, SVM, KNN, decision trees, and random forests.
* Understanding how to quantify and validate classification models including calculating a classification report
* Understanding how to apply `GridSearchCV` to hyper tune model parameters
* Understanding unsupervised learning and how to apply the kmeans algorithm

## Taks:
* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features
* Used MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data
* Separated the data into training and testing data
* Tuned Model Parameters
* Used GridSearch to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compare at least two different classifiers.
